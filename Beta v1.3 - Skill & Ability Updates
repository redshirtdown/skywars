Monk:
1. Page 43: The text for Deflect in the Monk tree (pg43), and possibly elsewhere, reads "When hit by a melee attack, may perform a Deflect incidental to suffer a number of strain no more than ranks in Deflect, then reduce the damage by 1 per rank in Reflect." The bold portion should read "per strain suffered".
  - Need to check this, I believe this is the wording in the FFG books.
#Skills: 
1. I Know Kung Fu - Change the wording to “Once per session, the character may reroll any 1 Athletics or Melee skill check.”
2. Remove Deflection and Intense Focus - recreate in ability 
3. Stunning blow is useless currently

1. Phantom blades spell not clear on attack/damage capabilities

Wizard (Page 78):
