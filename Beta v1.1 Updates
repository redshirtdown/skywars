# Beta v1.1 Updates

#Skills

#Warrior
Knight:
Blademaster:
1. Page 35: Blademaster talent tree duelist is spelled dualist. I realize this is likely a pun since it relates to using two weapons, however it comes across as a misspelling imo.
Dragoon:
1. Dragoon command abilities can be crazy powerful and might need to be nerfed

#Cleric
Monk:
1. Page 43: The text for Deflect in the Monk tree (pg43), and possibly elsewhere, reads "When hit by a melee attack, may perform a Deflect incidental to suffer a number of strain no more than ranks in Deflect, then reduce the damage by 1 per rank in Reflect." The bold portion should read "per strain suffered".
  - Need to check this, I believe this is the wording in the FFG books.

Paladin:
Priest: 
1. Page 47: In the priest talent section there is two 5 point talents in the 15 point row
2. Page 47: The Priest's Resurrection ability feels like it should be more expensive (maybe flip a destiny point or something)

#Rogue
Assassin:
Thief:
Air Pirate:

#Natura
Druid:
Barbarian:
Ranger:

#Mage
Sorcerer (Page 74):
1. Ball of light ability block named Jump on the Sorcerer Spell list on page 74.
2. The Sorcerer talent "Meteor Strike" reads like a detect magic spell

Warlock (Page 76):
1. Phantom blades spell not clear on attack/damage capabilities
2. Warlock Spell trees lack check boxes.
3. Vampiric Touch has same copy as Mount, actual skill copy: Vampiric Touch: Strain - 3 | Damage - 6 | Make a melee check. If successful, may deal damage and regain health equal to additional successes (not base damage).


Wizard (Page 78):
1. In the Wizard spell tree, 'Ice Storm' is given as the name to two different spells. One is the wall of ice spell.
2. Wizard Time Stop ability is crazy powerful and there's no limitations to how often it can be used
3. In the Wizard Spell tree the second Ice Storm should be renamed Wall of Ice and the connecting lines is missing.
4. Wizard Spell trees lack check boxes.

Bard (Page 79):
1. The Bard's Improved Scathing Tirade is titled Improved Soothing Song
