# Sky Wars Feedback/Issues/Errata

Gameplay feedback including issues and improvements with careers, talents, items, equipment, ships and more


1. [Blademaster Dance of Death's penalty is too long](https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/5jl3ol/sky_wars_edge_of_the_kingdom_a_free_120_page/dbh7bwk/)
2. [Druid Shapeshift ability is too difficult/costly](https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/5jl3ol/sky_wars_edge_of_the_kingdom_a_free_120_page/dbha5tl/)
3. The Firelord talent could be renamed to something like "Magic Flare" or "Burst of Power". Mainly because the characters won't always be using fire for the Blast effect
4. [Not a fan of Arcana](https://www.reddit.com/r/skywarsrpg/comments/5jm51d/sky_wars_feedbackissueserrata/dbipd4f/). It is basically Use Magical Device from earlier editions of DnD. There are a multitude of design reasons for that no longer being included in modern systems.
