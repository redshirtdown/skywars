# Publishing Errors & Updates

This covers all editing and design errors, including typos, formatting, text, image placement, etc.

1. [Move conversion context to sidebars in specific pages](https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/5jl3ol/sky_wars_edge_of_the_kingdom_a_free_120_page/dbhk9qg/)
  - Need to determine what page #'s need updating.
2. In terms of layout, I think some of the images are in the wrong places for the text they correspond to. For example on page 31, the pictures for Knight and Blademaster should be swapped. You read down a column, not across. 
  - This is fairly subjective, needs more feedback though I'm ambivalent either way.
3. Page 74: Ball of light ability block named Jump on the Sorcerer Spell list on page 74.
4. Page 91: Bastard Swords are larger than Long Swords. What you have labeled as Bastard would be more appropriately labeled as Short Swords.
5. Page 35: Blademaster talent tree duelist is spelled dualist. I realize this is likely a pun since it relates to using two weapons, however it comes across as a misspelling imo.
6. Page 78: In the Wizard spell tree, 'Ice Storm' is given as the name to two different spells. One is the wall of ice spell.
7. Page 47: In the priest talent section there is two 5 point talents in the 15 point row
8. Multiple pages: 'Ensnare' is typo'd to 'esnare' multiple times.
9. Page 91: 91 has parry and 'trust' in the small sword section.
10. Page 74: The Sorcerer talent "Meteor Strike" reads like a detect magic spell
11. Page 76: Phantom blades spell not clear on attack/damage capabilities
12. Page 13: On page 13 under the 'Brawl and Melee into Melee' - 'Brawn' should be 'Brawl' here.
13. Page 89: Page 89 under Reach reads "attacks at made at engaged..." which should drop the first "at".
14. Page 99: Air Ship Combat pg 99. The weapon headings have the EoTE weapon headings. It would be advisable to have the Sky Wars weapon headings and then in the text description detail the matching EoTE weapons.
15. You have [SETBACK] in at least one place instead of a graphic. The one I saw is on page the druid talent tree under outdoorsman.
16. Page 90/92: On page 90 you refer to Strain Damage as "SD" but in the tables on pages 90 and 92 the term "SH" is used.
17. Page 43: The text for Deflect in the Monk tree (pg43), and possibly elsewhere, reads "When hit by a melee attack, may perform a Deflect incidental to suffer a number of strain no more than ranks in Deflect, then reduce the damage by 1 per rank in Reflect." The bold portion should read "per strain suffered".
  - Need to check this, I believe this is the wording in the FFG books.
18. Page 66/122: Thick Skin on 66/122 has a word going past the margin.
