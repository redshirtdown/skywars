# Publishing Errors & Updates

This covers all editing and design errors, including typos, formatting, text, image placement, etc.

1. [Move conversion context to sidebars in specific pages](https://www.reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/5jl3ol/sky_wars_edge_of_the_kingdom_a_free_120_page/dbhk9qg/)
  - Need to determine what page #'s need updating.
2. In terms of layout, I think some of the images are in the wrong places for the text they correspond to. For example on page 31, the pictures for Knight and Blademaster should be swapped. You read down a column, not across. 
  - This is fairly subjective, needs more feedback though I'm ambivalent either way.
3. Page 74: Ball of light ability block named Jump on the Sorcerer Spell list on page 74.
4. Page 91: Bastard Swords are larger than Long Swords. What you have labeled as Bastard would be more appropriately labeled as Short Swords.
5. Page 35: Blademaster talent tree duelist is spelled dualist. I realize this is likely a pun since it relates to using two weapons, however it comes across as a misspelling imo.
6. Page 78: In the Wizard spell tree, 'Ice Storm' is given as the name to two different spells. One is the wall of ice spell.
7. Page 47: In the priest talent section there is two 5 point talents in the 15 point row
8. Multiple pages: 'Ensnare' is typo'd to 'esnare' multiple times.
9. Page 91: 91 has parry and 'trust' in the small sword section.
10. Page 74: The Sorcerer talent "Meteor Strike" reads like a detect magic spell
11. Page 76: Phantom blades spell not clear on attack/damage capabilities
12. Page 13: On page 13 under the 'Brawl and Melee into Melee' - 'Brawn' should be 'Brawl' here.
13. Page 89: Page 89 under Reach reads "attacks at made at engaged..." which should drop the first "at".
14. Page 99: Air Ship Combat pg 99. The weapon headings have the EoTE weapon headings. It would be advisable to have the Sky Wars weapon headings and then in the text description detail the matching EoTE weapons.
15. You have [SETBACK] in at least one place instead of a graphic. The one I saw is on page the druid talent tree under outdoorsman.
16. Page 90/92: On page 90 you refer to Strain Damage as "SD" but in the tables on pages 90 and 92 the term "SH" is used. This was slightly confusing as the explanation on page 89 had the header of Strain Damage (SD).
in the description it explains how you went from SD to SH but it is confusing.
17. Page 43: The text for Deflect in the Monk tree (pg43), and possibly elsewhere, reads "When hit by a melee attack, may perform a Deflect incidental to suffer a number of strain no more than ranks in Deflect, then reduce the damage by 1 per rank in Reflect." The bold portion should read "per strain suffered".
  - Need to check this, I believe this is the wording in the FFG books.
18. Page 66/122: Thick Skin on 66/122 has a word going past the margin.
19. The Bard's Improved Scathing Tirade is titled Improved Soothing Song
20. In the Wizard Spell tree the second Ice Storm should be renamed Wall of Ice and the connecting lines is missing.
21. The Warlock and Wizard Spell trees lack check boxes.
22. Page 95: The location/rarity modifier table for equipment on page 95 is below the item description for the Farcaller, and not above the Black Market heading
23. Page 93+: In the adversaries section all minions have their skills listed with a rating. Should those ratings be removed so it matches the standard rules from EotE?
24. Page 24: Gnome small size is different than Halfling. Consistent formatting.
