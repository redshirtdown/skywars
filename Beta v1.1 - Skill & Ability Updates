#Warrior
Knight:
Skills:
1. Replace Coercion from Bonus skills with Resilience
2. Natural Scrapper: Change the name of Natural Scrapper to Natural Warrior, as it fits the skills better
3. Custom Gear: I assume this is the same as the Jury Rigged Talent from EotE but you will need to state that or what improvements the character can choose from somewhere
4. Armor Master: Change the title of the talent E3 from Armor Master to Improved Armor Master, as it is different to the talent in C2
5. Lethal Blows: Remove Lethal Blows in B3 - This talent feels out of place in a Tree and Specialisation that is about defense.  Replace with Knight’s Discipline wording as “Reduce SETBACK from Cool and Discipline checks per rank”.
6. Correct the cost of Talent in D4 - Current cost is 5 when it should be 20
7. Armor Training: Change wording to “Reduce encumbrance of worn armor by 1 and SETBACK caused by worn armor per rank of Armor Training”  To make the talent more attractive.

3. Jolt: Change name to Rebuff  wording to “Attackers that fail to damage the character benefiting from Knight’s Defense are disoriented for 1 round”
4. Shield Wall: Reduce the area the slot takes up to only C1 and C2 (freeing C3)  Change wording to “When Knight’s Defense is active, as a maneuver the character may spend 2 strain to provide the defense rating of his equipped shield to another character in engaged range.”
5. Rushing Defense: Rename to Knight’s Aid and change the wording to “When activating the Shield Wall maneuver the character may spend move from Medium Range to engaged with a friendly character by spending one strain”.  
6. Range Talent: Remove and replace with Ease of Burden “Using Knight's Aid no longer costs additional strain”
7. Dig In: Change wording to “Knight's Defense now upgrades incoming melee and ranged attacks for one plus one for each 2 ADVANTAGE (TRIUMPH?) used”
8. Stun: Stun: Change Name to Improved Rebuff and the wording to “Attackers that fail to damage the character benefiting from Knight’s Defense are now staggered for 1 round”
9. Shield Bash: Change the ability from a maneuver to an action “When equipped with a Shield, the character may make a Melee check against an engaged.  If successful deal damage equal to Brawn plus SUCCESS and disorient the target for one round” Strain cost 2 Cost 10.  The Melee check is as per normal rules for melee attacks
10. New Ability C3: Hardy Shield, increase the defense rating of equipped shield by 1. Link to C4 and D3, cost 10
11. Shield Bash C4: Change name to Improved Shield Bash wording to “When performing the Shield Bash action, the target is disoriented for a number of rounds equal to the equipped shield’s defense rating” remove strain cost

15. Shield Throw: Change to Improved Shield Throw and the wording to “When performing the Shield Bash action at range the character will benefit from having a shield equipped as the shield returns immediately.”  Remove the range and strain subtext from the talent


Blademaster:
Dragoon:
1. Page 35: Blademaster talent tree duelist is spelled dualist. I realize this is likely a pun since it relates to using two weapons, however it comes across as a misspelling imo.
2. Dragoon command abilities can be crazy powerful and might need to be nerfed
#Skills:
1. Strong Arm - Change wording to “Increase the range of thrown weapons by the ranks of Strong Arm”
2. Defensive Stance A1 - Change to Lethal Blows
3. Dualist - Removed, to be replaced with Grit
4. Parry - Rename to Fencing Master.  This is because players may be confused with Parry from EotE and you may want to include Parry from EotE in the future
5. Experienced Dualist - Change to “Reduce the difficulty when attacking with two weapons by 1”
6. Replace Grit from B2 with Precise Strike from D3.  The character will benefit from accessing the tools of their talent tree early  and to also balance the other changes
7. Defensive Stance D1 - Replace with Knockdown
8. Swap Precise Strike from C3 with Blademaster from E4.  
9. BladeMaster - Remove the Strain cost to activate as the talent is now more expensive to get to and better matches the talent from EotE
10. Finishing Strike - Change to Flashing Steel and wording to “When attacking with two weapons you may allocate additional hits to other targets in range”
11. Hurl - Change wording to “The character may treat melee weapons with encumbrance of one as throwing weapons with Limited Ammo 1.”
12. Replace D3 with Dancer’s Draw with wording “The character may draw or holster a weapon or item as an incidental action a number of times a round equal to ranks in Coordination.”
13. Strong Arm E1 - Replace with Natural Warrior “Once per session the character may re-reroll any 1 Melee or Ranged check”
#Abilities
1. Dance of Death - edit the wording to “As a maneuver spend 4 strain and make an Average Coordination check.  For each net SUCCESS gain BOOST to all Melee and Ranged checks until the end of the encounter.  For each net DISADVANTAGE gain SETBACK on all other checks until the end of the encounter.  DESPAIR can be used to make SETBACK last until end of session”.


#Cleric
Monk:
1. Page 43: The text for Deflect in the Monk tree (pg43), and possibly elsewhere, reads "When hit by a melee attack, may perform a Deflect incidental to suffer a number of strain no more than ranks in Deflect, then reduce the damage by 1 per rank in Reflect." The bold portion should read "per strain suffered".
  - Need to check this, I believe this is the wording in the FFG books.

Paladin:
Priest: 
1. Page 47: In the priest talent section there is two 5 point talents in the 15 point row
2. Page 47: The Priest's Resurrection ability feels like it should be more expensive (maybe flip a destiny point or something)

#Rogue
Assassin:
Thief:
Air Pirate:

#Natura
Druid:
Barbarian:
Ranger:

#Mage
Sorcerer (Page 74):
1. Ball of light ability block named Jump on the Sorcerer Spell list on page 74.
2. The Sorcerer talent "Meteor Strike" reads like a detect magic spell

Warlock (Page 76):
1. Phantom blades spell not clear on attack/damage capabilities
2. Warlock Spell trees lack check boxes.
3. Vampiric Touch has same copy as Mount, actual skill copy: Vampiric Touch: Strain - 3 | Damage - 6 | Make a melee check. If successful, may deal damage and regain health equal to additional successes (not base damage).


Wizard (Page 78):
1. In the Wizard spell tree, 'Ice Storm' is given as the name to two different spells. One is the wall of ice spell.
2. Wizard Time Stop ability is crazy powerful and there's no limitations to how often it can be used
3. In the Wizard Spell tree the second Ice Storm should be renamed Wall of Ice and the connecting lines is missing.
4. Wizard Spell trees lack check boxes.

Bard (Page 79):
1. The Bard's Improved Scathing Tirade is titled Improved Soothing Song
